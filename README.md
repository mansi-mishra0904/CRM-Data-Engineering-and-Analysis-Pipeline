## 2. Introduction

### Business Objective  
This project aimed to improve business strategies by analyzing CRM data to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and team efficiency. By understanding these key areas, the business can enhance decision-making and customer relationships.

### Tech Stack  
- **PySpark** for data loading and transformation
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** for analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization

### Dataset Overview  
The project utilized five datasets:  
- **Customers**: Details customer demographics and purchase history.  
- **Products**: Information on product categories and pricing.  
- **Transactions**: Data on purchases, including product IDs, customer IDs, and sales volume.  
- **Interactions**: Records of customer support interactions across various channels.  
- **Sales Team**: Sales performance metrics for individual sales representatives.

## 3. Data Preparation and Validation

### Data Loading  
Data was loaded from CSV files into **PySpark DataFrames** to handle large datasets efficiently. Each file was loaded with schema inference and header detection.

### Initial Validation  
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Verified consistent IDs across datasets, ensuring transactions linked correctly to customers and products.
- **Error Identification**: Found missing customer IDs and inconsistent transaction dates.

### Data Cleaning  
- **Missing Values**: Imputed or removed missing values based on context (e.g., sales volume was recalculated using product price).
- **Duplicates**: Removed duplicate records to ensure data consistency.
- **Inaccuracies and Standardization**: Corrected misformatted dates and standardized categorical data.

## 4. Problem Statement Analysis

### Problem Statement 1: Ensuring Data Accuracy

#### Validation Process  
Data accuracy was ensured through cross-referencing with external datasets and validating relationships between tables.

#### Issues Identified  
- Inconsistent sales volumes for several transactions.
- Missing customer IDs in transaction records.

#### Recommendations  
- Automate **data validation** during data entry.
- Regularly perform **cross-dataset integrity checks** to catch discrepancies early.

### Problem Statement 2: Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

#### Analysis Methodology  
Customer purchase behavior was analyzed using **segmentation** based on spend levels, frequency of purchases, and geographic location.

#### Key Insights  
- **High-value customers** represented a small portion of the customer base but contributed to the majority of revenue.
- **Geographic patterns** showed Region A favoring premium products, while Region B preferred budget items.

#### Recommendations  
- Target high-value segments with **personalized offers** and campaigns.
- Adjust **regional marketing strategies** to align with customer preferences.

### Problem Statement 3: Product Sales Performance Evaluation

#### Analysis Methodology  
Product performance was evaluated by analyzing **sales volume**, **category performance**, and **price elasticity**.

#### Key Insights  
- **Top-selling products** consistently outperformed in sales across categories like electronics.
- **Price adjustments** led to significant changes in sales volume for certain categories.

#### Recommendations  
- Focus marketing efforts on **high-performing products**.
- Implement **dynamic pricing** to capitalize on price-sensitive products.

### Problem Statement 4: Customer Interaction Effectiveness

#### Analysis Methodology  
Interaction effectiveness was analyzed by evaluating resolution rates across communication channels (email, chat, phone).

#### Key Insights  
- **Email interactions** had higher resolution rates than phone or chat.
- **Younger customers** preferred chat, while older customers leaned towards phone support.

#### Recommendations  
- **Invest in email support** automation to improve efficiency.
- Align support channels with **customer demographic preferences** for better engagement.

### Problem Statement 5: Sales Team Performance Assessment

#### Analysis Methodology  
Sales team performance was assessed by tracking **individual and team metrics** against sales targets.

#### Key Insights  
- A few **top-performing representatives** consistently exceeded their targets.
- Significant **performance gaps** existed in certain regions.

#### Recommendations  
- Recognize and incentivize **top performers**.
- Provide additional **training and support** to underperforming representatives.
